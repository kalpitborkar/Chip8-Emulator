## What is chip-8?
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers, but CHIP 8 is still used today, due to its simplicity, and consequently on any platform and its teaching of programming Binary numbers.
